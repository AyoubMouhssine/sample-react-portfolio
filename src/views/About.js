      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Ayoub Mouhssine, a passionate 21-year-old web developer
        hailing from Morocco. My journey into the world of web development began
        with a simple curiosity sparked by a YouTube video.

      <p>
        I took the plunge into web development at IFMOTICA in Fes, Morocco.
        Here, I immersed myself in the exciting universe of HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React.js, PHP, and Laravel. Each line of code I write feels
        like crafting a piece of digital art.

        Beyond the screen, I'm an avid football enthusiast. Whether I'm cheering
        for my favorite teams or kicking the ball on the field, sports are my
        go-to for a perfect balance to my tech adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I've got my eyes on learning Java. There's something
        intriguing about its versatility and vast applications. It's the next
        big step in my tech journey, and I can't wait to explore its endless
        possibilities.
